Practice with Makefile and cmake

Makefile creates a static library called 'library_make.a' and executable file called 'program_make'.
To run Makefile, use command 'make' in your Terminal.

CMakeLists.txt creates a dynamic library called 'library_cmake' and executable file called 'program_cmake'.
To run CMakeLists.txt:
	1. Go to 'build' directory (command 'cd build').
	2. Write command 'cmake ..'.
